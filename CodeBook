GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the 
variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.


  The original data was transformed by

* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  
  Variables
* "subject Id" -> [1:30]
* "ictivity Id" -> (1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING)
* Measurements -> new_data set = the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from original dataset "fetures.txt"
                  summary_data set = from "new_data set", A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and 
                  each subject.
